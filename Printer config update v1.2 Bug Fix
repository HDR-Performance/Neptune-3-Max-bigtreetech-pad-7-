Purpose:
Added parking logic from PAUSE to lift the Z-axis by 2mm (or to max Z if closer) and move the toolhead to X425 Y425 (5mm from max X/Y of 430), ensuring it clears the print safely.
Enhanced shutdown sequence by explicitly adding M106 S0 to turn off the part-cooling fan, aligning with END_PRINT’s full shutdown (heaters, fan, LEDs, motors).
Retained original cleanup commands (BED_MESH_CLEAR, CLEAR_PAUSE, SDCARD_RESET_FILE) for consistency.
Notes:
Affected Component: [gcode_macro CANCEL_PRINT] controlling print cancellation behavior.
Behavior Before Change: Stopped the toolhead in place, turned off heaters and LEDs, disabled steppers, and performed cleanup, but did not move the toolhead to a safe position or explicitly shut off the fan.
Behavior After Change:
Parks the toolhead at X425 Y425 with a 2mm Z lift (if homed), matching PAUSE behavior.
Fully shuts down extruder heater, bed heater, fan, LEDs, and motors, consistent with END_PRINT.
Maintains cleanup of mesh, pause state, and SD card file.
Usage: Trigger via Mainsail’s cancel button or CANCEL_PRINT command in the console.
No Other Modifications: All other sections, including recent fan control macros, remain unchanged as per user request.
Testing Recommendation:
Start a print and execute CANCEL_PRINT mid-print.
Confirm the toolhead lifts Z by 2mm and moves to X425 Y425, then verify heaters, fan, LEDs, and motors shut off, with cleanup messages displayed.
